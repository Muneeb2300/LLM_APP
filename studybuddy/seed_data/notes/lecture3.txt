Web Development with Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

A simple Flask application:
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

To run this application, you would use the command `flask run`.

Flask is a great choice for small to medium-sized web applications and APIs. For larger applications, a more full-featured framework like Django might be a better choice. The concept of routing is central to Flask; it's the mechanism that maps URLs to the functions that handle them.
